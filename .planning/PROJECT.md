# FlowState

## What This Is

FlowState is a CLI-first context orchestrator that scaffolds agentic-framework projects (GSD and friends) — it runs a deterministic 5-step pipeline (Context Generation → Research → Strategy → GSD → Discipline), wraps `claude --print` for scoped LLM calls with budget/model overrides, and persists a searchable SQLite FTS5 memory across runs.

Lives at `/Users/jhogan/frameworx`, package `flowstate`, Python 3.12+, Flox-managed env, Claude Code CLI as the LLM bridge.

## Core Value

**Each run starts smarter than the last** — the pipeline produces durable artifacts (PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md, research/, memory.db) and auto-injects prior findings into subsequent runs, so the work compounds instead of repeating.

If everything else fails, that compounding loop is what FlowState exists to deliver.

## Requirements

### Validated

<!-- Shipped and confirmed valuable through prior milestones (v0.1–v0.2). -->

- ✓ 5-step pipeline orchestrator (research → strategy → gsd → discipline → context) — v0.2
- ✓ Pydantic-validated `flowstate.json` state with backward-compatible migration — v0.2
- ✓ Pluggable `ToolAdapter` pattern (research, strategy, gsd, discipline) — v0.2
- ✓ `ClaudeBridge` subprocess wrapper with `--allowed-tools`, `--max-budget-usd`, `--model`, `--effort` overrides — v0.2
- ✓ Synchronous `EventBus` with priority-ordered, error-isolated handlers — v0.2
- ✓ Persistent memory layer: SQLite + FTS5 (porter stemming, BM25 ranking) with auto-injection as `## Prior Knowledge` — v0.2
- ✓ 8-command Click CLI (`init`, `status`, `launch`, `run`, `context`, `memory`, `check`, `fresh`, `config`) — v0.2
- ✓ Interview flow + deterministic context-file generation (no LLM) — v0.2
- ✓ pytest + pytest-cov with 80% floor enforced via `--cov-fail-under=80` — v0.2
- ✓ **PIVOT-01..04**: v2 pivot landed (cli/discipline/launcher/memory/config edits + new config.py) — v0.3 / Phase 1
- ✓ **INST-01..03**: `install_manifest` on `FlowStateModel`; `init` populates with sha256; `fresh` consults manifest, reports orphans, `--force` removes them — v0.3 / Phase 2
- ✓ **DOCT-01..02**: pure-Python `flowstate doctor` (6 checks) + safe-by-default `flowstate repair` with `--apply-destructive` gate — v0.3 / Phase 2
- ✓ **STAT-01..02**: `flowstate status --markdown [--write FILE]` renders 3-section handoff doc (tools, active phase, memory stats) — v0.3 / Phase 2
- ✓ **HOOK-01..02**: `@handler(profile=...)` + `FLOWSTATE_HANDLERS` (minimal/standard/strict) + `FLOWSTATE_DISABLED_HANDLERS` precedence — v0.3 / Phase 2

### Active

<!-- Milestone v0.3 complete (Phases 1 + 2). Next milestone TBD. -->

_None — see `/gsd:new-milestone` to plan the next cycle._

### Out of Scope

<!-- Explicit boundaries with reasoning. -->

- **Declarative `hooks.json` per-project hook config** — `@handler` decorator is cleaner for now; revisit only if users need project-scoped hook definitions
- **Continuous-learning / auto "instinct" extraction from sessions** — ECC had silent-content-loss bugs here (v1.4.1 regression); leave promotion of session patterns manual until manual is the bottleneck
- **Cross-harness packaging** (Codex / OpenCode / Cursor adapters) — pulls FlowState off its `claude --print` bridge and adds 3+ install paths; defer until users ask
- **Formal eval/grading harness with pass@k metrics** — premature without enough run history to score against
- **Rust control-plane rewrite** — ECC's `ecc2/` is a 1-maintainer cautionary tale; Python is fine for FlowState's load
- **GUI dashboard** (Tkinter or Electron) — CLI + Rich is on-brand; dashboard is a maintenance sink
- **Paid tier / hosted SaaS / GitHub App** — different business model, not this project

## Context

- **v2 pivot landed (v0.3.0):** the formerly-unstaged v2 work committed cleanly in Phase 1 (b38bbd6) — `config.py` default-root resolution wired across the CLI, FTS5 sanitization, built-in tool markers, version at 0.3.0. Working tree is clean on `main`.
- **Codebase map fresh:** `.planning/codebase/` was just regenerated (2026-05-25) — STACK, ARCHITECTURE, STRUCTURE, CONVENTIONS, TESTING, INTEGRATIONS, CONCERNS. Use these as canonical reference during planning.
- **ECC comparison done:** Researched `affaan-m/ECC` (192K-star agent-harness performance system, 7-harness packaging, 60 agents, 232 skills, Rust rewrite in flight). Stole 4 patterns into this milestone (Active); explicitly rejected the surface-area-explosion patterns (Out of Scope).
- **Single maintainer.** Granularity choices favor "few broad phases" over many small ones to avoid coordination overhead.

## Constraints

- **Tech stack:** Python 3.12+, Click for CLI, Pydantic for state, SQLite + FTS5 for memory, subprocess for the Claude bridge. No new runtime dependencies in this milestone.
- **Coverage:** ≥80% enforced by `pyproject.toml` (`--cov-fail-under=80`). Pre-commit runs ruff (legacy + format), trailing-whitespace, EOF, large-file, merge-conflict, debug-statement checks.
- **Bridge:** Claude Code CLI v2+ must be locatable; FlowState invokes `claude --print` non-interactively. No direct Anthropic API calls.
- **Compatibility:** State migration must work from v0.1.0 → v0.2.0 → v0.3.0 (this milestone bumps minor).

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Coarse granularity (2 phases) | Single maintainer, scope is bounded, "one small phase" was the explicit user framing for the operate-safely work | ✓ Validated (v0.3) — both phases shipped clean |
| Land v2 pivot before adding new surface | Compounding the unstaged work with new features makes the diff unreviewable and the bug surface ambiguous | ✓ Validated (Phase 1, b38bbd6) |
| Skip Codex/OpenCode/Cursor adapters | ECC ships to 7 harnesses with one maintainer and it's visibly straining; FlowState stays Claude-Code-native until users ask | — Pending |
| Hook profile via env var, not config file | Matches ECC's pattern (`ECC_HOOK_PROFILE`) and avoids a new config surface; one env var + one filter pass at handler register time | ✓ Validated (HOOK-01/02) |
| Borrow install-manifest pattern from ECC | `flowstate fresh` is currently destructive without a manifest of what it owns — same gap ECC's `doctor`/`repair` exists to solve | ✓ Validated (INST-01..03, DOCT-01..02) |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd:transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd:complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
