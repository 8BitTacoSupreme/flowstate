# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-10)

**Core value:** Each run starts smarter than the last — durable artifacts + auto-injected memory make work compound across runs.
**Current focus:** Phase 23 — Linux Parity + Core Seam (v0.9.0 Sandbox Guardrail)

## Current Position

Phase: 23 (linux-parity-core-seam) — DISCUSSING
Plan: —
Status: Gathering phase context
Last activity: 2026-07-11 — v0.9.0 Sandbox Guardrail opened (SEED-003)

**Parked from v0.8.0:** Phase 22 (The Verdict) code shipped; the 5×3 paid benchmark run is OWED (see Blockers). `.planning/phases/22-the-verdict/` retained intact; v0.8.0 not archived.

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 36
- Average duration: ~15 min/plan

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v0.8.0 roadmap]: Phase order follows the SEED-001 dependency chain — 19 (tax accounting) → 20 (evaluator independence) → 21 (wiki production wiring) → 22 (verdict, capstone needing all three measurement primitives in place)
- [v0.8.0 roadmap]: Coarse granularity (4 phases, 19-22) — matches SEED-001's pre-scoped structure; single maintainer, phases map 1:1 onto the seed's four numbered sections
- [v0.8.0 roadmap]: Phase 21 is production wiring ONLY — the bench-side memory→wiki distiller (`bench/distiller.py`) already shipped in v0.6.2 Phase 17; this milestone does not rebuild it, only promotes/calls it and adds the opt-in reader flag
- [v0.8.0 roadmap]: Phase 22 flagged as expensive (live LLM runs, 4-5 arms x multiple trials x multiple runs for the compounding curve) — smoke at reduced trials/runs before scaling, per SEED-001's cost-reality note
- [Phase 13-01 / MECH-01]: research adapter gets Autoresearch's measure->keep/discard over OUTPUT — score each section vs the fixture's `retrieval_questions` (threshold 0.6, one bounded retry, discard-if-still-weak); the prompt is reused byte-identical on regeneration (no prompt self-modification in the runtime). All-discarded -> produced==0 -> success=False (preserves Phase 12 HON-03 fail-loud).
- [v0.7.0 roadmap]: Phase order is measurement-first — Phase 12 (dumps + significance tests + stratified split) lands before any config change, so every later phase's claims are falsifiable from the start rather than retrofitted
- [v0.7.0 roadmap]: Coarse granularity (6 phases, 12-17) — dependency chain is strictly linear (12→13→14→15→16→17) except Phase 16, which depends on 13 (prefix/cache) and reuses Phase 15's `rerank()`, but not Phase 14's chunk/rollup sweep (LoCoMo docs are short, never chunked)
- [v0.7.0 roadmap]: RERANK-01 is a hard gate inside Phase 15 — the cross-encoder (RERANK-02/03) is only built if the pool-ceiling analysis from Phase 12's dumps justifies it; a failed gate is a valid phase outcome, not a blocker
- [v0.7.0 roadmap]: Test split is touched exactly once, in Phase 17, after the config is frozen on dev-200 in Phase 14 — prevents tuning-on-test
- [v0.7.0 roadmap]: `bench/grounding.py` stays ADD-ONLY across all 6 phases; the query/document embedder interface and cache land in `bench/_retrieval.py`/`bench/_embed_cache.py` instead
- [v0.6.0 roadmap]: Coarse granularity (3 phases) — single maintainer; phases 9/10/11 follow natural dependency boundary (foundation → memory seam → wiki seam)
- [v0.6.0 roadmap]: Phase 10 and 11 kept separate (not merged) — each maps to a distinct integration seam (memory.py vs context_prefix.py) that can be independently planned and verified
- [v0.6.0 roadmap]: Phase 10 and 11 both depend on Phase 9 only; Phase 11 does not depend on Phase 10 (parallel seams over the same vector foundation)
- [v0.6.0 roadmap]: Embedder is optional [semantic] extra — FTS5 fallback preserved on every path; default install stays dep-free; golden context_prefix tests must stay byte-identical
- [Phase ?]: rowid resolution pattern for vec0 embed-on-write
- [Phase ?]: enable_load_extension security re-scope after vec load
- [Phase ?]: Phase 14-01 VEND-01/02: vendored gstack@7c9df1c (59) + superpowers@d884ae0 (14) as data-only trees; pruned build tooling 36M->4.4M for no-bin/T-14-02
- [Phase ?]: launch handoffs gated on installed .claude/skills/<namespace>; absent emits install-skills prompt (T-14-12)
- [Phase ?]: README test count reconciled to post-phase --collect-only total (1000), never hardcoded (T-14-15)
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 15-02 / GSD-02]: install_skills installs GSD unconditionally (no detect/prompt); full node_modules copied to .claude/get-shit-done/node_modules so gsd-sdk resolves deps by walking up (byte-identical to 15-01's proven tree); commands/gsd converted to .claude/skills/gsd-<cmd>/SKILL.md; copy-as-data, path-safe, idempotent, no shim
- [Phase 17]: [Phase 17-03 / HAR-03]: prepare_fixture wires flowstate.pack.run_pack + bench.distiller.main behind one entry point; arms without a producer (full/memory/none) are an accepted no-op, not an argparse rejection
- [Phase 18-01]: n==1 bootstrap edge case handled by the general resampling path (not a special branch); every size-1 resample naturally degenerates to ci_low==ci_high==mean
- [Phase 18-01]: Percentile CI indices use round(p*(resamples-1)) with a defensive ci_low<=mean<=ci_high clamp against 2-decimal rounding drift
- [Phase 18-01]: bench/report.py intentionally left untouched per plan scope note; no caller in this phase routes the CI through report.write_json
- [Phase 18-03]: E2E smoke writes producer artifacts (repomix-pack.xml, wiki/*.md) directly to disk instead of shelling out to repomix/npx, keeping the harness-of-harnesses gate CI-safe with zero external tool dependency
- [Phase 18-02]: close_loop uses module-reference imports (import bench.X as X) instead of from-imports so tests can monkeypatch bench.replicate._run_trial / bench.prepare_fixture.main effectively
- [Phase ?]: Phase 19-01 TAX-01: BridgeResult.usage/duration_s appended after existing fields (positional-ctor safe); json path parses only when output_format=json AND top-level result key present, else raw-stdout fallback with usage=None (never raises); cumulative totals accumulate only on successful returns
- [Phase 19-02 / TAX-02]: RunSnapshot gains real tokens_in/out/cache_read/wall_clock_s appended after layers_present with defaults (pure carriage — compute_scorecard byte-identical, no axis reads them); threaded end-to-end orchestrator bridge totals -> append_run_entry RUN metadata -> capture_run_snapshot (type-guarded metadata.get, 0/None fallback); adapters switched to output_format=json to capture usage (Plan 01 byte-identical .output, no extra LLM call); prefix_tokens kept as the DISTINCT Track-1 growth signal (input-context size), NOT repurposed for consumption
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 19-03 / TAX-03/04]: tax rendering lives entirely in bench/report.py (presentation-only) — per-arm tokens/seconds as a Track-2 block EXCLUDED from compounding_score; cost-per-success = (tokens_in+tokens_out)/summed verify_pass (passed flowstate verify acceptance gates, NOT run/commit count), gates_passed==0 -> n/a
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 20-01]: judge independence guard is a pure config-time helper (_validate_judges) reused by CLI + Wave-2; judge_run never-raise untouched; aggregate_judges reuses grounding._wilson via function-scope import; _PASS_THRESHOLD=7.0, even-N tie=fail (D-08), None excluded from denominator
- [Phase 20]: 20-02: independence guard enforced at compound_eval chokepoint before _real_loop; absent judge-model = empty set = hard stop (D-04); replicate threads a distinct judge/producer pair (D-06); IND-03 test locks compounding_score as judge-independent
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 21-01 / WIKI-03]: promoted bench/distiller.py to flowstate/distiller.py (imports nothing from bench/; _locate_claude delegates to bridge._find_claude mapping empty-string to None); bench is now a re-export shim; added kind=wiki manifest + is_wiki_stale (memory.db mtime gate mirroring is_pack_stale); flowstate distill is the explicit producer; run_pipeline untouched (D-03 fence)
- [Phase ?]: 21-02: opt-in wiki_layer flag wires the Phase-11 semantic wiki layer into production; default off byte-identical; [semantic]-absent is a one-time warning
- [Phase 21]: 21-03 dogfood test proves the wiki layer fires end-to-end (WIKI-06); real-memory dogfood skips on the empty checkout memory.db while a synthetic guard fires green
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 22-01 / VERD-01]: froze the verdict pre-registration in 22-PREREGISTRATION.md and committed it (a1f09aa) before any --mode real run (D-04); three-part GATING win rule (CI-excludes-0 AND Cohen's d>=0.8 AND survives-Holm), seed pinned 20260711 (D-08); bench/verdict.py (Plan 02) must implement this verbatim

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **OWED — v0.8.0 Phase 22 verdict run (parked 2026-07-11):** the pre-registered paired-design **5×3 real benchmark run (~5–7 hr, subscription, on a floxybot2 copy)** has NOT executed. Code shipped (verdict driver, pre-registration, research-grounding fix); resume with the gated one-trial re-verify probe → full run → apply the frozen Holm-gated rule → then archive v0.8.0. `.planning/phases/22-the-verdict/` is retained intact. Do NOT run `phases.clear` or `milestone.complete` on v0.8.0 until the verdict is recorded. Full resume detail in memory `flowstate-v08-phase22-paused` and `22-PREREGISTRATION.md`.
- **SECURITY (carried forward, unresolved):** an `OPENAI_API_KEY` was pasted into a chat session during the v0.6.0-era benchmark work. Rotate it if that has not already been done. Tracked here so the milestone reset does not erase it.
- **Benchmark integrity:** `bench/BENCHMARK_HANDOFF.md` §4 records that `_READER_INSTRUCTION` is a measured QA regression that is still the default reader prompt. Out of scope for v0.7.0 (retrieval-only), but no QA number should be quoted until it is addressed.

| 260710-ffo | Correct the benchmarking record — new bench/BENCHMARKING_SCOPE.md (two-track model: Track 1 retrieval/deterministic where BM25 is the incumbent counterfactual, vs Track 2 harness-value) + fix stale PAIRED_DESIGN_RUNBOOK.md (prereqs #1/#2 LANDED, #3 unbuilt; pack≈none vs wiki 0.825≈oracle). NOTE: its "dead-alias" claim about autoresearch/gstack/superpowers was WRONG and later corrected by erratum eab8ae8 — those are real MIT upstreams FlowState's adapters are named after and barely implement (v0.6.1 fixes that). | complete | 2026-07-10 | 9790284, c268cc9, e61ebe1, eab8ae8 |
| 260710-x5a | Harden bench/replicate.py::_run_trial — distinguish judge-output contract violations (malformed JSON / `per_run` row missing `score` → propagate/halt) from legitimate trial gaps (nonzero returncode, unreadable/missing output → None + diagnostic). Narrows `except Exception`→`except OSError`, checks subprocess returncode, moves JSON/score parse after the finally so a broken judge contract can't be silently averaged into the paired-bootstrap CI. close_loop.py unchanged (its pipeline guard surfaces a propagated error as exit 1).

| 260711-research-grounding-fix | Make the research arm participate in the Phase-22 verdict — (2) research groundedness scoring fails OPEN: `_score_groundedness` returns `float|None` (None sentinel on bridge-failure/unparseable, was 0.0->silent discard), `execute` keeps scorer-unavailable sections and reports them distinctly from discarded-low-score; (1) new `bench/ground.py::ground_from_repo` auto-derives a repo interview via ONE bounded json-mode claude call + repomix pack (fails loud on absent repomix), wired as a one-time real-mode setup step in `bench/verdict.py` (never per-trial); 22-PREREGISTRATION.md section 8 setup addendum (frozen win rule/arms/n unchanged). 91.21% cov, ruff clean, cheap-mode verdict green. | complete | 2026-07-11 | eccf4fd, f4cbdcc, 2b50b86 |

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-07-12T13:22:12.922Z
Stopped at: Phase 23 context gathered

**Why v0.8.0 exists (SEED-001, verified prior session):**

- No token/cost/latency accounting exists in `bench/`; `prefix_tokens` is `len(prefix)//4`, an input-context estimate, not consumption. `ClaudeBridge.run()` already accepts `output_format="json"` but no caller passes it and `BridgeResult` has no `usage` field.
- The proven-best context layer (distilled wiki + semantic retrieval, 0.825 ≈ oracle 0.800) is switched off in production — no `flowstate/` module passes `include_layers={"wiki"}`. The bench-side producer (`bench/distiller.py`) shipped in v0.6.2; only the production wiring is missing.
- `bench/judge.py` has no enforcement against judge-model == producer-model; `bench/metrics.py`'s `CompoundingScore` is the authoritative deterministic scorer and already excludes the judge from `compounding_score` — this milestone hardens the guard-rail, not the architecture.
- The harness-value experiment already ran once and came back null (Cohen's d 0.29); a null `wiki − none` on a real repo is an accepted, pre-registered-for outcome, not a failure to avoid.

Next step: `/gsd-plan-phase 19` — Phase 19 "The Tax" (real token/cost/latency accounting: `BridgeResult.usage`, `RunSnapshot` fields, `bench/report.py` per-arm tokens/seconds, cost-per-success denominator). Then Phase 20 (evaluator independence), Phase 21 (activate the wiki — production wiring only, bench-side producer already shipped), Phase 22 (the verdict — pre-registered paired-design run on a real repo; flagged expensive, live LLM runs).

---

**DEFERRED — established facts for v0.7.0 (verified, carry forward when v0.7.0 starts; phases renumber to 15-20):**

- `recall_any@5` = 0.966 for **both** BM25 and chunked-semantic; `recall_all@5` = 0.866 vs 0.844; `recall_all@10` = 0.946 vs 0.904. Gold sessions are already retrieved, at ranks 6–10 → a **ranking** problem. A perfect reranker over a top-R pool scores exactly `recall_all@R`, so dense→rerank@10 caps at 0.946 and BM25→rerank@10 caps at 0.904.
- The 0.866-vs-0.844 lead is **not currently testable**: both harnesses emit only aggregate means + Wilson CI, no per-instance records. McNemar flips around b+c ≈ 27 discordant pairs — it could land either side of p<0.05.
- LongMemEval-S is **type-blocked** (6 `question_type`s in 7 contiguous runs). `--limit 100` yields 70 `single-session-user` + 30 `multi-session` and zero temporal-reasoning/knowledge-update. Every historical `--limit` run was on a biased subset. Use stratified sampling.
- `|gold|` reaches 6 (3 instances), so `recall_all@5` has a structural ceiling of **0.994**, not 1.0. 0 abstentions in the file.
- `bench/grounding.py::_default_embedder` calls `model.embed()` for docs *and* queries; fastembed's `query_embed()` is a no-op passthrough → BGE's query instruction prefix is **never applied**. Free win, needs an `embed_fn` interface change (build it in `_retrieval.py`; grounding.py is ADD-ONLY).
- fastembed L2-normalizes (`_post_process_onnx_output` → `normalize()`), so `semantic_rank`'s L2 ordering ≡ cosine ordering. **Not a bug** — don't spend time there.
- Installed fastembed 0.8 ships cross-encoders (`Xenova/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` 80MB, `jinaai/jina-reranker-v1-turbo-en` 150MB, `BAAI/bge-reranker-base` 1.04GB) and 8192-token embedders (`jina-embeddings-v2-base-en`, `nomic-embed-text-v1.5-Q` 130MB). **Zero new deps needed.**
- LoCoMo currently **loses** to BM25 on semantic full-cov@5 (0.459 vs 0.481) — Phase 16 needs to report this honestly per-category, not paper over it.

Data: `data/longmemeval_s_cleaned.json` (265MB) + `data/locomo10.json` present; `data/` is gitignored (LoCoMo is CC BY-NC). Held for v0.7.0.

## Operator Next Steps

**Two tracks are live (frontmatter stays v0.8.0 — it is not yet shipped):**

- **v0.9.0 Sandbox Guardrail (active scoping, SEED-003, phases 23–25)** — scoped 2026-07-11. Requirements SBX-01..06 in REQUIREMENTS.md, phases 23–25 in ROADMAP.md, decisions in PROJECT.md. Start with `/gsd-discuss-phase 23` (or `/gsd-plan-phase 23`) — Phase 23 "Linux Parity + Core Seam" (`flowstate/sandbox.py` + the `wrap()` seam; Linux bwrap spike is the gating unknown).
- **v0.8.0 Phase 22 (The Verdict) — OWED, parked** — code shipped; the 5×3 real paired-design benchmark run (~5–7 hr, paid, on a floxybot2 copy) has NOT executed. Resume with the gated one-trial re-verify probe, then the full run, then archive v0.8.0. Do **not** run `phases.clear`/`milestone.complete` on v0.8.0 until the verdict is recorded.

*(Historical: Phase 19 "The Tax" already shipped — the `/gsd-plan-phase 19` line below is stale.)*

> **Planning override (Phase 20, 2026-07-11):** decision-coverage gate reported 1/7 by structured `must_haves.truths` scan, but the semantic plan-checker PASSED and plans cite D-01..D-08 60+ times in bodies with full concept coverage. Proceeded with override — verify-phase should re-confirm all 8 CONTEXT decisions landed in code.
